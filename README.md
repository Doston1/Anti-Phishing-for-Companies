# Anti-Phishing-for-Companies

This project was created and written for a 5 point bagrut in Computer Science - Cyber in 2019, while I was studying in the 12th grade in Shevach-Moffet high-school.

The project was a website for company managers to check if their workers know enough about phishing and know how to defend themselves.

A manager could register to our website, give us the emails of his workers, choose a template for a (fake) phishing mail and get from us statistics about how many workers fell into the trap, how many workers opened the mail, how many of them entered the malicious link and  how many tried to login into the fake website we sent them. After loginning in and giving us their credentials, the workers entered a site that told them they fall into the trap, and explained them about phishing and how to defend themselves from it.

The project has 2 parts in it, the server side and the client side. 
The server side was written mainly in Node.js, using express, mongoose, nodemailer, Heroku, and the postman tool.
The client side was written mainly in JS, using Angular.
